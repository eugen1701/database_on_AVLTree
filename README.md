# database_on_AVLTree
Here I implemented a little game in order to test the AVL Tree with duplicates that I code. It is also my Data Structure project.
There I encountered many errors in order to make it fully functionally.
I added a menu based feature and all the steps of the project. 
To run it. It just need to run the projectMenu.py
